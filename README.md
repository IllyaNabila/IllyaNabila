# 👋 Introduction

Hi there! I’m **Illya Nabila**, a curious and creative final year Software Engineering student currently exploring the world of **Software Maintenance and Evolution** 🚀

I’m fascinated by how software grows, changes, and adapts over time — kind of like living organisms that need care and updates to stay healthy 🧩. Through this course, I hope to sharpen my understanding of **modern maintenance strategies**, **legacy system handling**, and how to **keep software sustainable and reliable** for years to come.

## 🎯 Fun Fact

I believe every old piece of code has a story — and maintaining it is like time-traveling through someone else’s logic ✨
